-To check types of variable, we use interpreter.
eg: >>> type(gg)
    <type ’str’>
    >>> type(x)
    <type ’int’>
    >>> type(pi)
    <type ’float’>

-We get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names when we give a variable an illegal name:
+ 99gg is illegal because it does not begin with a letter.
+ r* is illegal because it contains an illegal character, the star sign.
+ for = " bla bla bla" is illegal because "for" is one of the python keywords.
